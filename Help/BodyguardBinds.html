        <h2>Bodyguard Mode Binds</h2>
        <p>"Bodyguard Mode" is a feature of Mastermind pets that enable them to share / reduce damage taken by the Mastermind.  Setting pets to "Defensive / Follow" or "Defensive / Stay" or "Defensive / Goto" will put them into Bodyguard Mode.</p>
        <p>With BindControl, you can specify which pets you'd like to function as bodyguards, and set them all into that mode (Defensive / Follow) with a single keystroke.  "Stay" is also available for the bodyguarding pets.</p>
        <p>For this feature to work reliably, each pet has to have a unique name in-game, and those names have to be entered into BindControl.</p>
        <p>Telling pets to attack or move or putting them into Aggressive or Passive mode will take them out of Bodyguard Mode.  They can be returned to Bodyguard Mode at any time by using one of the Bodyguard Mode binds.</p>
