        <h2>Buffer Binds</h2>
        <p>A <b>Buffer Bind</b> is a type of keybind designed to help players buff their team members using multiple presses of the same key</p>
        <p>A Buffer Bind can contain up to three buffing powers, with an optional chat/emote step to be activated with each power.</p>
        <p>The Buffer Bind pane allows you to specify a bind key for each team member and for each pet.</p>
        <p>The first press of a given key will select the associated team member or pet.  Subsequent presses of the key will activate the buffing powers, in order.  This allows you to buff each of your team members and/or pets with quick repetitive presses of one key per target.</p>
        <p><i>Buffer Binds are a work in progress, and improvements are coming, including allowing for more than three powers per Buffer Bind</i></p>
