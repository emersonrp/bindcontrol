        <h2>Complex Binds</h2>
        <p>A <b>Complex Bind</b> is a keybind that will perform strings of commands, in rotation, with multiple presses of a key.</p>
        <p>For example, a bind could be created that, on first press of the bound key, will change to a given costume and change the game's windows colors to match.  On a second press of the key, the bind could change to a different costume, and again change the window colors to match.</p>
        <p>After the final step, the Complex Bind will "wrap around" to the first step.</p>
        <p>A Complex Bind could be thought of as a series of Simple Binds that are performed in rotation.</p>
        <p>As with Simple Binds, because of game limitations it's only possible to activate one power per step.  You can create Complex Binds with multiple power activations per step, but they will probably not act as you expect.</p>
