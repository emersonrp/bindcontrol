        <p>Extra controller modifiers were added in Homecoming Issue 27, Page 1.  They can be used to make extra "chord"-style binds using a controller.  The details of this scheme are too complicated to summarize here.  Please check the <a href="https://wiki.homecomingservers.com/wiki/Issue_27_Page_1#Enhanced_Gamepad_Support">Patch Notes</a> for details.</p>

        <p>Note that BindControl does <b>NOT</b> set up these modifiers for you.  This configuration is intended to match whatever configuration you have manually added to the game with the <code>/controller_modifiers</code> and <code>/extra_modifiers</code> commands.</p>
