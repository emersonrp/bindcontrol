        <h2>Default Speed on Demand Mode</h2>
        <p>If you are using Speed on Demand, this picker allows you to select the Default Mode that Speed on Demand will be in.</p>
        <p>The Default Mode is the mode that Speed on Demand will use with the movement keys initially, and will return to when toggled out of any other mode, or when keybinds are reset.</p>
        <p>Often this is left at the default "Sprint" but if you prefer to keep a different movement power's Speed on Demand Mode active instead, you can select that here.</p>
        <p>You can leave this completely blank if you'd prefer no Speed on Demand at all initially and when toggling out of specific modes.</p>
