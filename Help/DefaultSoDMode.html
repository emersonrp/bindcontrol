        <h2>Default Speed on Demand Mode</h2>
        <p>If you are using Speed on Demand, this picker allows you to select the Default Mode that Speed on Demand will be in.</p>
        <p>The Default Mode is the mode that Speed on Demand will return to when toggled out of any other mode, or when keybinds are reset.</p>
        <p>Often this is left at the default "Sprint" but if you prefer to keep a different movement power in Speed on Demand mode typically, you can select that here.</p>
