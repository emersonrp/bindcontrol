        <h1>Escape Configurator</h1>

        <p>By default, City of Heroes binds the <code>Escape</code> key to <code>/unselect</code>, which clears any target selection you might have.  This is a reasonable thing for <code>Escape</code> to do, but over the years, we've come to expect more things from it.</p>

        <p>With the Escape Configurator, you can assign the <code>Escape</code> key to do any number of interesting and useful things.  This can help make City of Heroes feel more like modern games, though sometimes the effects can be a little fiddly and unexpected.  Tinkering is encouraged.</p>

        <p>The functions that this Wizard can bind to <code>Escape</code> are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Unselect</b> - clear any target selection you currently have, leaving you with nothing targeted.  This is the default behavior.</li>

            <li><b>Unqueue</b> - unqueue / cancel any queued power.  This can be useful if you find yourself changing your mind a lot about what to cast next, though having both this and <b>unselect</b> bound might be a bit frustrating.</li>

            <li><b>Close All Windows</b> - this will close all "non-essential" windows, leaving just the normal chat, nav, player, target, and power trays showing, depending on how you have your UI normally configured.</li>

            <li><b>Exit Completed Mission</b> - teleport out of a completed mission, equivalent to clicking the "Mission Complete" button.</li>

            <li><b>Reset Camera</b> - reset the camera to the default distance behind the player.</li>

            <li><b>Choose No Reward</b> - if a reward dialog is open, after a mission arc, for instance, this will close the dialog, choosing no reward.</li>

            <li><b>Answer No to Dialog</b> - equivalent to choosing "OK" or "No" or "Cancel" on any dialog being shown.</li>

            <li><b>Show Main Menu</b> - pop up the game's main menu.  This could work well with <b>Close All Windows</b> or could be frustrating and annoying in that case.  You do you.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Various combinations of these commands make better sense than others, but you can choose any or all of them.  All that you choose will be bound to each press of <code>Escape</code>, so choose wisely, and experiment to discover what feels right.</p>

        <p>This Wizard is a work in progress, and any and all feedback is welcome.</p>
