        <h2>Fly Power Key Action</h2>

        <p>The <b>Fly Power Key Action</b> picker determines what the <b>Fly Power Key</b> will do when pressed.  Some options might not be available depending on your power picks and/or Speed on Demand settings.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Speed on Demand</b> - the Fly Power Key will toggle between Fly SoD Mode and your Default SoD Mode as configured in the Speed on Demand Settings box.</li>

            <li><b>Speed / Defense Toggle</b> - the Fly Power Key will toggle between your primary fly power and Hover, allowing you to select between speed and defense manually.  If either power is unavailable, this mode will simply toggle the available one.</li>

            <li><b>Main Power Toggle</b> - the Fly Power Key will toggle your primary fly power on and off.</li>

            <li><b>None</b> - the Fly Power Key will be disabled.</li>
