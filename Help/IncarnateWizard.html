        <h2>Incarnate Set Wizard</h2>
        <p>You can use the Incarnate Set Wizard to set up a full or partial set of Incarnate Powers that will be slotted using multiple presses of the bound key.  Multiple presses are required because of in-game limits on the length of keybinds, combined with the rather long names of some Incarnate Powers.</p>
        <p>Click on any slot to select a power to install into that slot.</p>
        <p>Choose "Disable Slot" to remove whatever power is in that slot, when the keybind is applied.</p>
        <p>Empty slots will not be changed when applying the keybind.  You can right-click on any slot to clear it.</p>
        <p>In-game, when you press the bound key, you'll /tell yourself the progress of installing the set, for instance "1/3, Press Again" means you need to press the key a total of three times to install the set completely, so you'll need to press it two more times.</p>
