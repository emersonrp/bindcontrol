        <h2>Jump Power Key Action</h2>

        <p>The <b>Jump Power Key Action</b> picker determines what the <b>Jump Power Key</b> will do when pressed.  Some options might not be available depending on your power picks and/or Speed on Demand settings.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Speed on Demand</b> - the Jump Power Key will toggle between Jump SoD Mode and your default SoD Mode as configured in the Speed on Demand Settings box.</li>

            <li><b>Speed / Defense Toggle</b> - the Jump Power Key will toggle between your primary jump power and Combat Jumping, allowing you to select between speed and defense manually.  If either power is unavailable, this mode will simply toggle the available one.</li>

            <li><b>Main Power Toggle</b> - the Jump Power Key will simply toggle your primary jump power on and off.</li>

            <li><b>None</b> - the Jump Power Key will be disabled.</li>
