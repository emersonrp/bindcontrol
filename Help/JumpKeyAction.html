        <h2>Jump Power Key Action</h2>

        <p>The <b>Jump Power Key Action</b> picker determines what the <b>Jump Power Key</b> will do when pressed.  Some options might not be available depending on your power picks and/or Speed on Demand settings.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Speed on Demand</b> - the Jump Power Key will toggle between Jump SoD Mode and your Default SoD Mode as configured in the Speed on Demand Settings box.</li>

            <li><b>Power Toggle</b> - the Jump Power Key will toggle between your Primary and Defensive Jump powers.  If either is unavailable, this will toggle the other one on and off.  If Speed on Demand is active with another powerset, it will be turned off until it is reset with <b>Speed on Demand Toggle</b> or <b>Reset Keybinds</b>.</li>

            <li><b>None</b> - the Jump Power Key will be disabled.</li>
