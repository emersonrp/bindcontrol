        <h1>Keep Existing / Default Tray Binds</h1>
        <p>Normally, BindControl's binds are added to the game's default set of binds.  In the case of the power tray buttons, this can cause some display confusion as well as unexpected results, and so BindControl treats these differently by default.</p>
        <p>For instance, suppose you were using the "Modern" Keybind Profile in-game, and then in BindControl you activated the checkbox for the Tertiary power tray, and assigned the Tertiary Tray keys to be <code>Ctrl-1</code> - <code>Ctrl-0</code>.</p>
        <p>Once the BindControl binds were loaded, assuming the default set of <code>Shift-1</code> - <code>Shift-0</code> had not been reassigned somewhere else, <b>both</b> sets of binds would be active for the power tray buttons, and only the "primary" one would be displayed on the buttons in-game.  This is probably not the desired result in this case.</p>
        <p>Therefore, by default, <b>for the power tray keys only</b>, BindControl will remove what it expects are the existing binds for any key that you define a keybind for.  <b>NOTE</b>:  in order for this to work correctly, you must set the "Keybind Profile" picker in BindControl to match the one in the Options Menu &gt; Keybinds in-game.</p>
        <p>If you check the box for "Keep Existing / Default Tray Binds" then BindControl will not do this, and will "double up" any existing keybinds as described above.</p>
        <p>It is most likely that leaving the box unchecked will give the behavior you expect.</p>
