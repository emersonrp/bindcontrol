    <body>
        <p>Choose from among several styles of Mastermind binds.  Only one can be active in a given Mastermind Profile.</p>

        <h5>Simple Selection Binds</h5>
        <p>These binds are a system of pet selection that enables previous-pet / next-pet keybinds.  This is useful, for instance, for players wishing to buff each pet without having to select each one directly, or to give repeated orders to multiple pets in succession.</p>

        <p>Increase / Decrease Pet Group Size is used to tell the binds the size of your group of pets.  This is necessary because keybinds have no way of knowing your pet group size, and therefore are not able to "wrap around" from the last pet to the first without being told the size of the group.</p>

        <h5>Sandolphan Binds</h5>

        <p>The Sandolphan binds provide one-key selection of all pets or selection by power level, and binds for selecting pet stance and for giving orders.  The binds can optionally have the pets respond to orders via petsay, self-/tell, or into local chat.</p>

        <p>The stance and command binds will apply to your currently selected pet(s), whether selected via "Select All," "Select Minions," "Select Lieutenants," or "Select Boss," or via by-name selection.</p>

        <p>Bodyguard Mode will set the designated pets as Defensive/Follow, which provides significant damage reduction for the Mastermind.  Giving any bodyguard further orders will likely take it out of bodyguard mode until the Bodyguard key is pressed again.</p>

        <h5>qwy Numpad Binds</h5>

        <p>The qwy Numpad Binds are an intricate system of keybinds centered around using mod keys with the number pad to select, buff, and heal pets, and to give orders.  The binds are arranged such that a given key does similar but slightly different things with each modifier key, covering almost all possible Mastermind commands and powers.</p>

        <h5>qwy PetMouse Binds</h5>

        <p>The qwy PetMouse Binds are a simple but powerful system of keybinds that focus on using the mouse, along with modifier keys and an optional popmenu, to offer quick and simple command of pets.  While they don't have the functionality or flexibility of the Sandolphan or Numpad binds, they can cover 90% of Mastermind playstyle without removing your hands from the mouse and "home position" WASD keys.</p>
