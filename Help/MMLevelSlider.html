        <h2>Mastermind Level</h2>
        <p>If you are below level 24 (Homecoming) or 26 (Rebirth), you can use the "Mastermind Level" slider to match your in-game level, which will make sure only pets that are available to you are enabled in BindControl.  If you are at that level or above, just leave the slider at the max.</p>
