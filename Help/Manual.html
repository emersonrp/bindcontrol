        <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>BindControl is a tool to help create, modify, and maintain keybinds for City of Heroes.</p>
            <p>It supports multiple profiles, allowing you to keep separate bind configurations per archetype or even per character.</p>
            <p>BindControl is intended for players who would prefer using a GUI tool, instead of a text editor, to create and manage their keybinds.  It can also create complex, multi-file keybind systems that would be near-impossible to create by hand.</p>

        <h1>Concepts</h1>

            <h3>Profiles</h3>
            <p>A Profile is a configuration of keybinds managed by BindControl.  A profile is always loaded in BindControl, be it a new profile or one that's been loaded from a save file.  Any editing or modifications done to the keybinds can be saved in the profile, or in a new profile.  Profiles are named, typically with short names for reasons discussed later.</p>

            <h3>KeyBinds / BindFiles</h3>
            <p>A Keybind is a mapping of a command or string of commands to a key or mouse button.  BindControl offers a variety of ways to create and maintain key binds, and writes them to BindFiles which City of Heroes loads to "install" the keybinds.  Keybinds have various constraints on their contents and length, but BindControl attempts to help wrangle these and produce valid, useful keybinds.</p>

            <p>BindFiles install their KeyBinds when loaded, and a KeyBind can, when triggered, load a BindFile. This is leveraged in many places in BindControl to enable complex behavior using a limited number of keys.</p>

            <h3>Pages</h3>
            <p>When editing a profile, BindControl divides various related groups of keybinds into Pages, accessible via tabs at the top of the application.  Pages include general Gameplay features, Custom Binds via PowerBinder, Mastermind pet control binds, and Movement Powers / Speed on Demand.  Each page will be discussed in greater detail below.</p>

            <h3>PowerBinder</h3>
            <p>PowerBinder is a flexible tool for stringing together individual commands into custom KeyBinds.  It is the most open-ended tool in BindControl, and can help create fun and useful behavior including activating powers, emotes, and costume changes; targeting friends or foes by distance and name;  Chat commands and feedback;  and using Inspirations.  It additionally allows completely free-form commands to be added for the brave and experimental.</p>

            <p>PowerBinder will allow you to add multiple powers to a single bind, but because of game constraints, <b>only one power will be executed in a single bind</b>.  For more info on what is and is not possible with custom binds, check the Homecoming wiki for "<a href="https://homecoming.wiki/wiki/The_Incomplete_and_Unofficial_Guide_to_/bind">The Incomplete and Unofficial Guide to /bind</a>".</p>

            <p>PowerBinder is a concept borrowed wholesale from citybinder, and owes much to it.</p>

            <h3>Binds Directory</h3>
            <p>Once you have your profile set up, BindControl will need to write the resulting bindfiles somewhere where City of Heroes will be able to load them.  Because keybinds have a limited length, and because many of the features of BindControl involve loading other bindfiles from keybinds, it is <b>strongly</b> recommended to keep the path to the Binds Directory as short as possible to minimize the length of the filename to load.  Historically, c:\coh\ was used by citybinder, and this is still a great place to place keybinds if possible.</p>

            <p>Additionally, if multiple sets of bindfiles are desired, they can be saved inside individual profile directories in the Binds Directory.  For this reason, it is also strongly recommended to keep Profile names short, and not to use spaces in Profile names.</p>

            <h3>The "Write Binds" button</h3>
            <p>The "Write Binds" button is always available across the bottom of the window, and will attempt to write the bindfiles as currently configured in the profile.  If it encounters any errors, it will say so and present a log window that might help figure out what went wrong.  Typically this will not happen.  Writing binds takes almost no time and has little overhead, so feel free to iterate your config, write the files, and test them in-game over and over as needed.</p>

        <h1>Pages</h1>
            <h3>Preferences</h3>
            <p>The Preferences Dialog has several options that apply to BindControl globally and are not saved per-profile.</p>

            <p><u>Base Binds Directory</u></p>
            <p>This is where City of Heroes will find the bind files that BindControl sets up.  Because this path is used inside keybinds, which are length-limited, it needs to remain as short as possible, and contain no spaces.  c:\coh\ is the traditional choice, but you can set up any directory you like here.</p>

            <p><u>In-Game Binds Directory - <i>MacOS / Linux only</i></u></p>
            <p>If you are running BindControl on MacOS or Linux, it is assumed that you will be running City of Heroes via Wine.  In this case, the file paths visible to City of Heroes from within Wine will be different from the file paths visible to BindControl when writing binds. The in-game binds directory is to tell City of Heroes where to find the bindfiles <b>from within Wine</b>. For example, you might set the Base Binds Directory to <code>$WINEPREFIX/drive_c/coh/</code> and then In-Game Binds Directory to <code>c:\coh\</code>.  Configuring Wine is beyond the scope of this manual, but Wine users are familiar with this class of problem, so I have faith you can work it out.</p>

            <p>With respect to the admonition to keep the Base Binds Directory short, in the case where you are running via Wine, it is instead important to keep this, the In-Game Binds Directory, as short as possible.</p>

            <p><u>Binds Reset Key</u></p>
            <p>Various of the keybind systems generated by BindControl, most especially the Speed on Demand binds, load other bindfiles with every keystroke.  Depending on CPU usage and server lag, it's theoretically possible to get binds stuck in a strange state, leading to behavior like powers not turning off or movement continuing after a key is released.  This happens less in the 2020s than it did when the game was new, but just in case, the Binds Reset Key will reset all BindControl binds to their initially-loaded state and stop all movement.</p>

            <p><u>Bind left and right modifier keys separately</u></p>
            <p>City of Heroes supports separate binds for the left and right modifier keys (SHIFT, ALT, and CTRL) when they are used alone or in the "right-hand" position with another modifier key, eg, just "LSHIFT" or "ALT+RCTRL."</p>
            <p>Binding "LCTRL+R" does not work, and doing so manually in-game will simply bind "CTRL+R" -- this is how the game is implemented and is out of BindControl's influence.  The left versus right modifier keys are only treated separately on the "right-hand" side of a bind.</p>
            <p>This is a fiddly scheme but BindControl attempts to support it, so this preference is here, and sets up the Key Binder dialog to honor left versus right modifier keys in the "right-hand" position of a keybind.</p>
            <p>It can also be toggled on or off when binding a key, if you want to mix and match your side-specific and side-agnostic keybinds.  This is not super recommended, but you do you.</p>

            <p><u>Set all binds to default before reapplying</u></p>
            <p>This adds a command to the Binds Reset Key behavior that returns <b>all</b> keybinds to the default state set up by City of Heroes, before applying the BindControl binds.  This can be useful in the case where you've accidentally bound some vital key to something strange and are having trouble getting back.  This is on by default, as the behavior when it's on is probably how you expect this all to work.  You can turn it off if you are adding key binds that are not managed by BindControl and that you don't want removed on reset.</p>

            <p>This feature works by calling the <code>/keybinds_reset</code> slash command, which will reset your binds to whatever Keybind Profile you have selected in the game's "Keybinding" options tab.</p>

            <p><u>On startup, start with</u></p>
            <p>This enables you to select whether you'd like BindControl to start up with a fresh profile each time, or if you'd prefer to keep working with the last profile you saved.  By default it is set to the latter.</p>

            <h3 name="General">General</h3>
            <p>The General page contains the Profile name, as well as information about the archetype and powers available for this profile.  This information is used to help pick powers inside PowerBinder and other places, as well as to enable and configure the Speed-on-Demand and Mastermind pet binds.</p>

            <h3 name="Gameplay">Gameplay</h3>
            <p>The Gameplay page offers various quality-of-life binds and bind systems.</p>
            <p>Most notably, there is a combined Team/Pet selector system, as well as a scheme for enabling next/previous teammember selection.</p>
            <p>In addition, there are binds to quit to desktop, to invite your target to a group, and turn on and off the FPS Meter and the Netgraph.</p>
            <p>Finally, there are chat binds that can start chat commands in various ways, as well as optionally showing a "typing" indicator</p>

            <h3 name="CustomBinds">Custom Binds</h3>
            <p>The Custom Binds page is where you'll create any bespoke binds you'd like that aren't covered by other pages and systems.</p>
            <p><u>Simple Binds</u></p>
            <p>To add a new Simple Bind to the page, click the New Simple Bind button at the top.  You'll be prompted to name your custom bind, and then presented with a small pane where you can select the key for the keybind and launch PowerBinder to create the bind string.  If the bind doesn't have both of these things complete, or ends up longer than 255 characters, when you attempt to Write Binds, an error will be raised and the bind will not be written to the bindfiles.</p>

            <p><u>Complex Binds</u></p>
            <p>To add a new Complex Bind to the page, click the New Complex Bind button at the top.  A complex bind allows you to string together a sequence of steps, using PowerBinder, that will execute in rotation with repeated presses on the bind key.  This could be useful for creating sequences of attacks to be cast using (multiple presses of) a single key, to set up emotes and chats and pet actions for roleplaying, or really for anything you can dream up.</p>

            <p><u>Buffer Binds</u></p>
            <p>To add a new Buffer Bind set to the page, click the New Buffer Bind button at the top.  A buffer bind set comprises up to three buffing powers that will be cast sequentially by multiple presses of the same keybind, and keys for each team member and/or pet that will do the buff rotation.</p>

            <p><u><i>More Custom Bind Types to come...</i></u></p>

            <h3 name="SoD">Movement / Speed on Demand</h3>
            <p>This page is where you configure movement keys as well as other movement features.  It is most typicallly used to configure <b>Speed On Demand.</b></p>

            <p>Speed on Demand is a system by which fast, expensive travel powers get toggled as-needed when movement keys are pressed. This is intended to increase mobility and reduce endurance drain without having to manage travel powers manually.</p>

            <p>If you enable Speed on Demand binds, the standard movement keys will be rebound to use Speed on Demand (unless you configure a different set of keys for Speed on Demand movement).  Optionally, mousechord (pressing both buttons at once) can also be rebound to use Speed on Demand.</p>

            <p>Speed on Demand has a default mode, which is usually set either to Sprint, which will toggle Sprint on and off when running on the ground, or to your primary movement power, which will set that up as the on-demand power.</p>

            <p>If you have multiple travel power types (speed and jumping, for instance), it's possible to set up a key to toggle the Speed-on-Demand mode for any power that's not the one used for the default mode.  Pressing this key will set up the movement keys to use that power;  pressing it again will return to the default mode.  Some players prefer to leave the default mode on "Sprint" and explicitly turn on and off their main movement powers;  others prefer having their favorite movement power set as the default.  Experiment!</p>

            <p>There is a bind for the "Non-SoD Key" which will temporarily turn off Speed on Demand until pressed again.</p>

            <p>It's possible to have the binds auto-select different detail levels and camera distance when moving.  This was historically used for lower-power GPUs during the mid-2000s but the settings can still help when running the game on a laptop or other old hardware, or just if it's your preference.</p>

            <p>The available movement power configurations are informed by the power pool and archetype selections made on the <u>General</u> tab.</p>

            <p>Additionally, if you have multiple travel power types, there is support for various useful combinations of powers, such as "Hover when Teleporting" which will enable a Hover power between teleports, and "Super Speed / Super Jump Mode" which will toggle on Super Jump when the jump button is pressed, and Super Speed when it is released.</p>

            <p>This page also contains support for the binds to change among the various Kheldian shapechange forms and automatically set up power trays and movement keys for each form.</p>

            <p><i>Temporary travel powers will be added in a future version of BindControl.</i></p>

            <h3 name="InspPopper">Inspiration Popper</h3>
            <p>The Inspiration Popper offers the ability to use classes of inspirations from a single key, either preferring smallest-first or largest-first.  That is to say, for instance, a single key can be bound to Accuracy inspirations, and it will try to use any accuracy inspiration in your inventory, starting with the most powerful.</p>

            <p>Optionally the Inspiration Popper can give you feedback that it was used, via self-/tell.</p>

            <h3 name="Mastermind">Mastermind / Pet Binds</h3>

            <p>This page contains a set of binds to select individual pets by name.  This requires you tell BindControl the names of your pets, and that their names not contain spaces.  The game will do a "best match" on the name you provide, so short unique substrings of longer names can help here.  For instance, for a pet named "Stan The Man," unless you have another pet named with the phrase "stan" in it somewhere, "stan" would be a good choice for BindControl to use.</p>

            <p>The Pet Action binds offer one-key selection of groups of Mastermind pets as well as one-key orders for stance and action. By default it uses the numeric keypad, but they can of course be rebound anywhere.  Each key optionally can give feedback via self-/tell, local chat, or petsay.</p>

            <p>In addition, the binds support having any subset of your pets flagged for Bodyguard Mode, which can be toggle on and off.  If toggled on, the indicated pets will go into Bodyguard Mode (Defensive+Follow) and the stance and command keys will only apply to the remaining pets.  <strike>There is also the option to order your non-Bodyguard pets to Attack or Goto</strike> - <i>this is not working as intended</i>.</p>
            <p>Finally, the page offers a set of binds to select your "next" or "previous" pet, for quickly iterating through your pets for buffing, for instance.  There are also keybinds to set the binds' idea of what your pet group size is.  This is so that the binds can "wrap around" from the last pet to the first and vice versa, and is necessary because keybinds can't know, without being told, how many pets you have active.</p>

        <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
        <p><i>My binds aren't working as I'd expect, help!</i></p>
        <p>First, double-check BindControl to make sure you have things set as you expect.  There are a lot of checkboxes and controls and keybind dialogs, and it's possible you accidentally changed something or forgot something.</p>

        <p>Second, check the Log Window (under the "Log" menu at the top of BindControl), which might have some interesting and relevant errors related to what you're seeing.  BindControl won't actually succeed at writing binds to files in a variety of error conditions, so it's possible BindControl gave up and the bind files simply don't contain all of the binds you are expecting.  Optimally, the dialog that appears after pressing "Write Binds" will not mention any errors.</p>

        <p>Finally, it's possible, even likely, that you've found a bug.  Please go to the <a href="https://github.com/emersonrp/bindcontrol/issues">BindControl Github page</a> and file an issue.</p>

        <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
        <p>BindControl is a reimplementation of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/citybinder/">citybinder 0.76</a> by konoko and monorail_jjs, with refinements and additions. It owes its existence, overall structure, and much internal logic to citybinder and wouldn't exist without it.<p>

        <p>Additionally, updates and improvements from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/citybinder-for-homecoming/">CityBinder for Homecoming</a> have been added, per its author tailcoat's gracious permission.  tailcoat also made a prerelease version of CB4H available so that BindControl could implement improvements to the Inspiration Popper.</p>
