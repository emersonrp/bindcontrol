        <h2>BindControl's Output Files</h2>
        <p>This is a high-level overview of the various directories and files output by BindControl when you click the "Write Binds" button.  These will be written to the profile-specific binds directory configured within BindControl.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>reset.txt</dt>
            <dd>This is the bindfile that gets loaded when you press your "Reset Keybinds" key.  It reloads and resets all of BindControl's state to be as if you had just installed the binds for the first time.  <b>Simple Binds</b> from the <u>Custom Binds</u> page and some of the binds from the <u>General</u> and <u>Gameplay</u> pages end up in here, as well as the initial/base state of most binds from the <u>Movement Power</u> page.</dd>

            <dt>cbinds buff wiz</dt>
            <dd>These directories are created from the <u>Custom Binds</u> page.  <b>Complex Binds</b> will all drop their bindfiles in the <b>cbinds</b> directory, Buffer Binds will create bindfiles in the <b>buff</b> directory, and various <b>Bind Wizard</b> binds will drop their bindfiles in the <b>wiz</b> directory.</dd>

            <dt>teamsel teamsel2</dt>
            <dd>These directories are generated by the <u>Gameplay</u> page, and contain the bindfiles for the two different team selection keybind schemes.</dd>

            <dt>nova.txt dwarf.txt</dt>
            <dd>These files are created by the <u>Movement Powers</u> page when the Profile is for a Peacebringer or Warshade and any Kheldian-specific keys are configured.</dd>

            <dt>R F J S N Q AR AF AJ AS AN AQ FR FF FJ FS FN FQ BO GBO</dt>
            <dd>These one- and two-letter directories are created from the <b>Speed On Demand</b> binds, depending on how the <u>Movement Powers</u> page is configured.  No configuration will have all of these directories, but a typical Speed on Demand setup could have as many as eight or ten of them.</dd>

            <dt>dtp tp ttp</dt>
            <dd>These directories are also created by the <u>Movement Powers</u> page, and pertain to the various teleport power binds.  <b>dtp</b> contains files for Kheldian Dwarf teleport powers, <b>tp</b> standard teleport powers, and <b>ttp</b> Team Teleport.</dd>

            <dt>mmb petsel</dt>
            <dd>These directories are created by the <u>Mastermind</u> page.  <b>mmb</b> contains the various bindfiles needed for the Pet Action Binds, while <b>petsel</b> contains the bindfiles for the rotational pet selection keybinds.</dd>
