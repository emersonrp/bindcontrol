        <h1>Pet Action Binds</h1>

        <p>The pet action binds are a flexible system for controlling mastermind pets, based on Sandolphan's Revised MM Numpad Pet Controls from 2006.  They provide one-key selection of all pets or selection by power level, eg "Select Minions," and binds for selecting pet stance and for giving orders.</p>

        <p>The binds can optionally have the pets respond to orders via petsay, self-/tell, or into local chat.  The pets' chattiness can be toggled via a keybind, if you're tired of hearing them talk.</p>

        <p>The stance and command binds will apply to your currently selected pet(s), whether selected via "Select All," "Select Minions," "Select Lieutenants," or "Select Boss," or via by-name selection or next/previous pet selection.</p>

        <p><a href="https://homecoming.wiki/wiki/Mastermind_Strategy#Bodyguard">Bodyguard Mode</a> will place the pets you have designated as bodyguards into Defensive/Follow, which offers significant damage reduction for the Mastermind.  Giving any bodyguard further orders will likely take it out of bodyguard mode until the Bodyguard key is pressed again.</p>

        <p><i>Note - the game, by default, has built-in pet feedback that will also be said in addition to any response you specify here.  To quiet the default feedback, in-game, go to: Menu &gt; Options, select the "Windows" tab, and in the "Pets" section, set "Pet Response Text" to "Disabled."</i></p>
