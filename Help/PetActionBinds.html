        <h1>Pet Action Binds</h1>

        <p>The pet action binds are a flexible system for controlling mastermind pets, based on Sandolphan's Revised MM Numpad
        Pet Controls from 2006.  They provide one-key selection of all pets or selection by power level, eg "Select All Minions" and
        binds for selecting pet stance and for giving orders.</p>

        <p>The binds can optionally have the pets respond to orders via petsay, self-/tell, or into local chat.  The pets' chattiness
        can be toggled via a keybind, if you're tired of hearing them talk.</p>

        <p><i>Note - the game, by default, has built-in pet feedback that will also be said in addition to any response you specify
            here.  To quiet the default feedback, in-game, go to: Menu &gt; Options, select the "Windows" tab, and in the "Pets"
            section, set "Pet Response Text" to "Disabled."</i></p>
