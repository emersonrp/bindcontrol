        <h2>Pet By-Name Binds</h2>
        <p>These binds allow you to select pets by-name.  This is simply an alternative to selecting pets directly by their position in the pet list.  As Masteminds can rename their pets, you can specify the name you want to use.</p>
        <p>The game will attempt to match the first closest match to the specified name.  For instance, if your pet is named "Maximillian" the bind could use "Max" and, assuming you didn't also have a pet named "Maximus," the bind would work.</p>
