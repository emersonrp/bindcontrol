        <h2>Pet Names</h2>

        <p>In order for most of BindControl's Mastermind binds to work properly, your pets need to have unique names.  This means that you'll need to rename some of your pets from the default.  BindControl can help you do this.</p>

        <p>Background: when giving pet commands using their names, City of Heroes matches the names using substrings, meaning if you have pets named <i>Inky</i>, <i>Blinky</i>, <i>Pinky</i>, and <i>Clyde</i>, trying to give commands by-name to <i>Inky</i> will also give these commands to <i>Blinky</i> and <i>Pinky</i>.  This is a limitation/feature of the game and outside of BindControl's influence.</p>

        <p>For best results, you'll want to select pet names that are adequately different from each other.  As you enter these names into the fields on the Mastermind page, BindControl will show an error state on any names that don't fit this requirement.  You'll want to iterate over your desired pet names until none of the name fields are highlighted in red.</p>

        <p>Once you have the names set up uniquely, you can use the "Rename Pets" button to create a keybind that will rename all of your pets in-game to the desired names.  For this to work, you'll need to summon all of your pets before using the "Rename Pets" keybind.  If you don't do this, the results will probably end up being not what you expect.</p>

        <p>If you ever decide to rename your pets, you'll want to do this process in BindControl again and regenerate your keybinds and any optional Mastermind popmenus in order to keep things working as expected.</p>

        <p>Though it's possible to play a Mastermind successfully with the default pet names, most of BindControl's Mastermind keybind styles rely on unique pet names to work correctly, and so going through this process is highly recommended.</p>
