        <h2>Pet Names</h2>
        <p>In order for various pet selection and command keys to work properly, your pets need to have unique names.  This means that you'll likely need to rename some of your pets from the default.  BindControl can help you do this.</p>
        <p>When giving pet commands, City of Heroes matches pet names using substrings, meaning if you have pets named <i>Inky</i>, <i>Blinky</i>, <i>Pinky</i>, and <i>Clyde</i>, trying to give commands to <i>Inky</i> will also give commands to <i>Blinky</i> and <i>Pinky</i>.  This is a limitation of the game and outside of BindControl's influence.  For best results, select pet names that are adequately different from each other.  BindControl will show an error state on any names that don't fit this requirement.</p>
        <p>Once you have the names set up uniquely, you can use the "Rename Pets" button to create a keybind that will rename all of your pets in-game to the desired names.  For this to work, you'll need to have summoned all of your pets before using the "Rename Pets" keybind.  If you don't do this, the results will probably end up being not what you expect.</p>
        <p>If you are below level 24 (Homecoming) or 26 (Rebirth), you can use the "Mastermind Level" slider to match your in-game level, which will make sure only pets that are available to you are enabled in BindControl.  If you are at that level or above, just leave the slider at the max.</p>
        <p>If you don't intend to use the by-name selection binds or the Sandolphan Binds' "Bodyguard Mode" you can leave these names blank or otherwise in an error state, but this is strongly not recommended.</p>
