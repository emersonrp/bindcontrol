        <h2>Pet Names</h2>
        <p>In order for various pet selection and command keys to work properly, your pets need to have unique names.  This means that you'll likely need to rename some of your pets from the default.  BindControl can help you do this.</p>
        <p>When giving pet commands, City of Heroes matches pet names using substrings, meaning if you have pets named <i>Inky</i>, <i>Blinky</i>, <i>Pinky</i>, and <i>Clyde</i>, trying to give commands to <i>Inky</i> will also give commands to <i>Blinky</i> and <i>Pinky</i>.  This is a limitation of the game and outside of BindControl's influence.  For best results, select pet names that are adequately different from each other.  BindControl will show an error state on any names that don't fit this requirement.</p>
        <p>Once you have the names set up uniquely, you can use the "Rename Pets" button to create a keybind that will rename all of your pets in-game to the desired names.  For this to work, you'll need to have summoned all of your pets before using the "Rename Pets" keybind.  If you don't do this, the results will probably end up being not what you expect.</p>
        <p>Though it's possible to play a Mastermind successfully with the default pet names, most of BindControl's Mastermind keybind styles rely on unique pet names to work correctly, and so going through this process is highly recommended.</p>
