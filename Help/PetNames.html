        <h2>Pet Names</h2>
        <p>In order for the various pet selection and command keys to work most properly, your pets need to have unique names.  This means, for most powersets, that you'll need to rename one or more of your pets from the default, most likely two minions and a lieutenant, using the in-game "Rename Pet" function.</p>
        <p>Once you have uniquely named your pets in-game, you need to input the names you have chosen into BindControl.  If you ever rename your pets in-game again, you'll need to update the names in BindControl and rewrite your bind files.</p>
        <p>The "Default" button will change BindControl's names to the default pet names for your powerset.  This will likely put the name fields into an error state, as the default names contain duplicates, and BindControl will detect this.</p>
        <p>If you don't intend to use the by-name selection binds or Bodyguard Mode, you can leave these names blank or otherwise in an error state, but this is strongly not recommended.</p>
