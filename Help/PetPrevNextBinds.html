        <h1>Pet Previous / Next Binds</h1>
        <p>These binds are a system of pet selection that enables previous-pet / next-pet keybinds.  This is useful, for instance,
        for players wishing to buff each pet without having to select each one directly.</p>
        <p>Increase / Decrease Pet Group Size is used to tell the binds the size of your group of pets.  This is necessary because
        keybinds have no way of knowing your pet group size, and therefore are not able to "wrap around" from the last pet to the
        first without being told the size of the group.</p>
