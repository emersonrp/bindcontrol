        <p>The Popmenu Editor helps you create, edit, import, and otherwise manage your installed popmenus.</p>
        <p>In order to do this, you will need to set up your Game Directory in the preferences dialog.  BindControl can then create the directory structure for popmenus, if it doesn't exist already.  <i>BindControl currently only supports the layout of Homecoming installations for popmenus.  This will likely be improved in a later release.</i></p>
        <p>You can use the buttons in the upper left to create a new popmenu from scratch, to import one from a file, or to uninstall / delete one completely.</p>
        <p>The list on the lower left contains all popmenus installed to the menu directory.  You can select any of the menus and test it using the "Test" button at the top.  Right-click anywhere on a popmenu to edit that menu entry or create a new one.</p>
        <p>Menus shown in <i>italics</i> have not yet been loaded into BindControl.  Selecting one will automatically load it.  Menus shown in <b>boldface</b> contain unsaved changes.</p>
        <p>Use the "Write Menu" button to save your changes to a popmenu.</p>
        <p>The "Generate Macro" button will create a simple macro command you can paste into the game to create a macro button that will pop up the popmenu.</p>
