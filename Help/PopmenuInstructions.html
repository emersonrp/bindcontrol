        <p>The Popmenu Editor helps you create, edit, import, and otherwise manage your installed popmenus.</p>
        <p>You can use the buttons in the upper left to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>create a new popmenu from scratch</li>
            <li>import a popmenu from a file</li>
            <li>uninstall / delete a popmenu completely</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The list on the lower left contains all popmenus installed to the menu directory.  You can select any of the menus and test it using the "Test" button at the top.</p>
        <p>Right-click on any entry in a popmenu to edit that entry or create a new one.</p>
        <p>Menus shown in <i>italics</i> have not yet been loaded into BindControl.  Selecting one will automatically load it.  Menus shown in <b>boldface</b> contain unsaved changes.</p>
        <p>Use the "Write Menu" button at the top to save your changes to a popmenu.</p>
        <p>The "Generate Macro" button will create a simple macro command you can paste into the game to create a macro button that will pop up the popmenu.</p>
