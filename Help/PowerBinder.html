        <h1>PowerBinder</h1>

        <p>PowerBinder is a powerful and flexible tool for creating keybinds with multiple commands or actions.  It can, for instance, create a keybind that will change your costume, say something to your teammates, load a different BindControl profile, and change your window colors to match your new costume, all with a single press of a key.</p>

        <p>It's also useful for simpler keybinds where the syntax of the slashcommand might be fiddly or complicated -- PowerBinder hides all of this complication behind simple dialog boxes and controls.</p>

        <p><b>NOTE</b> that City of Heroes only allows a single power activation per keybind.  While PowerBinder will allow you to create keybinds that have multiple power activations in them, the game will only honor one of them, so the results might not be what you expect.</p>

        <p><u>The Main Window</u></p>

        <p>PowerBinder's main window features a list of "commands" that will be added to the keybind in order.  You can add commands with the "Add Command" picker at the top, and can rearrange, edit, and delete existing commands using the buttons on the right.  The read-only text box at the bottom shows the actual current contents of the keybind.</p>

        <p><u>Commands</u></p>

        <p>PowerBinder creates keybinds from a sequence of commands.  A command typically consists of a single slashcommand plus the various options that the slashcommand might require.  A given command might, for instance, specify a chat command, or toggle in and out of supergroup mode, or activate a given power.  Each type of command has its own UI for configuring it, apart from a few very simple command types.</p>

        <p>Some command types might add multiple slashcommands to the final keybind.</p>

        <p>Current command types include:</p>
