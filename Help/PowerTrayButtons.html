        <h2>Power Tray Buttons</h2>
        <p>The Power Tray Buttons section offers the ability to rebind the keys that trigger the buttons in the main powers trays in the game's UI.  The defaults are set to the same as the "Modern" profile from Homecoming Issue 27, Page 7.</p>
        <p>If you don't want to change these keybinds from the defaults, it's perfectly reasonable to leave the "Server Tray" and "Tray #" rows unchecked and use the game's existing keybinds.  This functionality is just for people who are interested in this degree of control over their keybinds.</p>
