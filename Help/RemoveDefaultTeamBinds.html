        <h2>Remove Default Team Select Binds</h2>
        <p>The Combined Team/Pet Select Binds can completely replace the functionality of the game's built-in team select binds, if you prefer to use them that way.  Checking this checkbox will clear / remove the default team selection binds when you load or reset the bind set.</p>
        <p>There is no particular advantage or disadvantage to doing this, it's a matter of personal preference.</p>
        <p>In order to make this work, the "Keybind Profile" selector, above, will need to be set to match your in-game setting.</p>
