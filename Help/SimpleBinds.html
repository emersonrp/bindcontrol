        <h2>Simple Binds</h2>
        <p>A <b>Simple Bind</b> is a custom bind that can perform a string of commands.</p>
        <p>For example, a bind could be created that changes costume, performs an emote, and says the character's battle cry to the group channel.</p>
        <p>Because of game limitations, only one actual power can be triggered by a keybind.  It's possible to create Simple Binds with multiple power activations included, but it will probably not act as you expect.</p>
