        <h2>Speed on Demand Toggle Key</h2>
        <p>The <b>Speed on Demand Toggle Key</b> will turn Speed on Demand on or off globally.  If you toggle Speed on Demand off, the movement keys will no longer toggle any travel powers until you turn Speed on Demand back on.</p>
        <p>Note that this is different from the <b>Reset Keybinds</b> key (<code>Ctrl</code>+<code>R</code> by default), which will reset your character's movement to stationary and reload all keybinds.  Resetting keybinds will re-activate Speed on Demand into the Default Mode.</p>
