        <h2>Speed on Demand Modes</h2>
        <p>When Speed on Demand is active, it is usually in a "Mode" corresponding to a given type of travel power -- for instance, Speed on Demand might be in "Sprint Mode" or "Fly Mode" or "Jump Mode" at a given moment.  It's also possible to have no Mode active.</p>
        <p>The active Mode determines what powers will be toggled on and off when using the movement keys.  Modes are activated using the Power Keys defined in the travel powers settings boxes, below.</p>
        <p>This picker allows you to select the Default Mode that Speed on Demand will be in.</p>
        <p>The Default Mode is the Mode that Speed on Demand will use initially, and will return to when toggled out of any other Mode.  The Default Mode does not have a specific key assigned to it, as it can be entered at any time by turning off any other Mode, by toggling Speed on Demand globally, or by resetting keybinds.</p>
        <p>Often this picker is left at the default "Sprint" but if you prefer to keep a different movement power's Speed on Demand Mode active instead, you can select that here.</p>
        <p>You can also leave this picker blank if you'd prefer no default Speed on Demand and want to activate each mode explicitly.</p>
