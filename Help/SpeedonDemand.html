        <h2>Speed on Demand</h2>
        <p><b>Speed on Demand</b> is an intricate system of movement keybinds, originally developed by Gnarly in 2004, that activate a travel power while moving and deactivate it when stationary, typically switching to a "slower" defense-friendly power.</p>
        <p>For example, with Speed on Demand in Fly Mode, pressing any movement keys will activate "Fly" for as long as they are held.  Once all movement keys are released and the character becomes stationary, "Hover" will be activated instead.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this is to minimize endurance use, and, secondarily, to maximize defense during combat, without having to manage travel powers manually.</p>
        <p>Flight powers will toggle between Fly or Mystic Flight and Hover;  Jumping powers will toggle between Super Jump or Mighty Leap and Combat Jumping.  Super Speed will simply toggle on and off as you move, as there is no defense-increasing "slower" power in that pool.</p>
        <p>Because of the complicated nature of these keybinds, it's very occasionally possible for a toon to get "stuck" moving in a direction if several movement keys are pressed and released quickly.  If this happens, using the "Keybinds Reset" key (<code>Ctrl</code>+<code>R</code> by default) will reset your character's movements and the state of the Speed on Demand binds.</p>
