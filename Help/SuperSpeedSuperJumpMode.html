        <h2>Super Speed / Super Jump Mode</h2>
        <p>Super Speed / Super Jump Mode is a feature for players that have both a Super Speed power and a Super Jump power available to them.</p>
        <p>With this checkbox checked, when a player is in Super Speed SoD Mode, jumping will immediately activate the Jump Power for as long as the jump key (typically <code>Space</code>) is held down.  When the jump key is released, the Jump Power will be deactivated, and Super Speed will be reactivated.</p>
        <p>Super Speed / Super Jump Mode is part of Speed on Demand, and is not available if the Speed Key Action is set to Power Toggle or None.</p>
        <p>Though this is a fun and quick way to get around, it might require some practice to avoid taking falling damage from releasing the key too early and switching back to Super Speed in mid-air.</p>
