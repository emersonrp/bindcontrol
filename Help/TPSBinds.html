        <h1>Team / Pet Select Binds</h1>
        <p>These binds enable direct one-key targeting of teammates and pets.</p>
        <p>'Team / Pet Select Mode' determines how repeated keypresses will select teammates and pets.  For instance, when the mode
        is "Teammates, then pets", if 'Select First Team Member / Pet' were bound to <code>F1</code>, then pressing F1 would select
        the first teammate.  Pressing it a second time would select your first pet.  Repeated presses would alternate
        between the two.</p>
