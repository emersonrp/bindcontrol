        <h1>Team Select Binds</h1>
        <p>These binds enable teammate selection via "next" / "previous" keybinds.  This is useful, for instance,
        for players wishing to buff each member of their team without having to select each member directly.</p>
        <p><b>Increase / Decrease Team Size</b> is because keybinds have no way of knowing your team size, and therefore are not able to "wrap around" from the last teammate to the first without knowing the size of the team.  Set this to match your team size.</p>
        <p><b>Increase / Decrease Team Position</b> sets which position in the team list you occupy for the purpose of the keybinds.  If the keybinds know that you occupy a given position, the next/prev binds will skip over you.  The binds default to "No Slot" which will leave you in the rotation.  <i>This does not actually move you in the team order in-game</i> -- it should be set to match your team position in-game if you wish to enable the skipping-yourself behavior.  Leave this alone if you want to include yourself in the rotation.</p>
        <p>Reset Team Rotation will reset the binds completely, returning you to solo team size, with no position set.</p>
