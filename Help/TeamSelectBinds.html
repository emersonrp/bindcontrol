        <h1>Team Select Binds</h1>
        <p>These binds enable a system of teammate selection that includes next / previous keybinds.  This is useful, for instance,
        for players wishing to buff each member of their team without having to select each member directly.</p>
        <p>Increase / Decrease Team Size is necessary because keybinds have no way of knowing your team size, and therefore are not
        able to "wrap around" from the last teammate to the first without being told the size of the team.</p>
        <p>Increase / Decrease Team Position moves which slot in the team rotation you occupy for the purpose of the keybinds.  If the keybinds know that you occupy a slot, the next/prev binds will skip over you.  The binds default to "No Slot" which will leave you in the rotation.  <i>This does not actually move you in the team order in-game</i> -- it should be set to match your team position in-game if you wish to enable the skipping-yourself behavior.</p>
        <p>Reset Team Rotation will reset the binds completely, returning you to solo team size, with no position set.</p>
