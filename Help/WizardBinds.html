        <h2>Custom Bind Wizard Binds</h2>
        <p>The <b>Launch Custom Bind Wizard</b> button will allow you to launch a Bind Wizard that will guide you through building a Custom Bind to create some useful but complicated keybind.</p>
        <p>Anything a Bind Wizard does could be handled manually using a <b>Complex Bind</b>, but the Bind Wizard makes it easier to create and maintain these more elaborate keybinds.</p>
        <h5>Available Wizards:</h5>
