        <h2>qwy Numpad Binds</h2>
        <p>The qwy binds are a Mastermind keybind scheme posted to the Homecoming forums by user <b>qwy</b> in 2020.</p>

        <p>They use modifier keys and the number pad to select pets, individually or in groups, and to give them orders.</p>

        <p>They also optionally use a custom window and a popmenu to access commands.  Use the checkboxes to select whether to install either or both of these.  Both are recommended, but require that you have your "Game Dir" set up correctly in the Preferences dialog.</p>

        <p>The chart below is simply informational, showing what each key combo will do with various selections.  Update the "Pet Selection" picker to see the differences depending on the current pet selection.</p>
