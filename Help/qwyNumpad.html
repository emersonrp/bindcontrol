        <h2>qwy Numpad Binds</h2>
        <p>The qwy binds are a revision/subset of a Mastermind keybind scheme posted to the Homecoming forums by user <b>qwy</b> in 2020.</p>

        <p>They use modifier keys and the number pad to select pets, individually or in groups, and to give them orders.</p>

        <p>The chart below is simply informational, showing what each key combo will do with various selections.  Update the "Pet Selection" picker to see the differences depending on the current pet selection.</p>
