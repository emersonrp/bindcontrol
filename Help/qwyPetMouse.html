        <h2>qwy PetMouse Binds</h2>

        <p>The PetMouse Binds are a simple but powerful set of Mastermind keybinds that mostly use mod keys plus the mouse to select and give orders to pets individually and in groups.</p>

        <p>They also utilizes the <b>2</b> key, easily accessible from the normal WASD hand position, for the "Attack" command.</p>

        <p>The binds can install and use an optional, but highly recommended, popmenu, which is triggered via the <b>4</b> key.</p>

        <p>These binds were posted to the Homecoming forums by user <b>qwy</b> in 2020.  More information can be found on <a href="https://forums.homecomingservers.com/topic/20788-i26-the-masterminds-petmouse-new-menu/">the original forums post</a>.</p>
