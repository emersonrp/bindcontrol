        <h2>qwy PetMouse Binds</h2>

        <p>The PetMouse Binds are a simple but powerful set of Mastermind keybinds that mostly use mod keys plus the mouse to select and give orders to pets individually and in groups.</p>

        <p>The binds can install and use an optional, but highly recommended, popmenu, which offers quick access to pet functionality using keys easily accessible from the WASD "home" position.  You will need to have set up your Game Directory in the Preferences dialog for this to be installed.</p>

        <p>You can set these binds to any keys or mouse actions you like, but the defaults are highly recommended, as they allow easy control of pets without removing your hands from the mouse and the WASD keys.</p>

        <p>These binds were posted to the Homecoming forums by user <b>qwy</b> in 2020.  More information can be found on <a href="https://forums.homecomingservers.com/topic/20788-i26-the-masterminds-petmouse-new-menu/">the original forums post</a>.</p>
